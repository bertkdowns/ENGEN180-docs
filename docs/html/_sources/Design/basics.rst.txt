Design Basics
=============

Paradigm Shift
--------------

This is when lots of people think a newer design is better and everyone stops using the old one.

If you make a paradigm shift you did good. (probably.)

Computer Aided Design
---------------------

You can use computers for design. It makes life easier. Avoid over reliance though.
