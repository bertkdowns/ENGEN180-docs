Estimation
==========

Estimations have to be BELIEVABLE

Estimation strategies:
	- Simplify the geometry - model a complex shape as some boxes or something
	- Use analogies - "humans about the density of water, but a bit less, so a 70kg person will probably have a volume of like 75 litres"
	- Scale from one to many - "A basketball probably weighs 500g, so 100 basketballs probably weigh about 50kg"
	- Extrapolate from a sample - "I know a basketball weighs 500g. So these 50 pieces of various sports gear probably weigh 25kg, because they are each more or less the weight of a basketball" 
	- Place limits on your answers - if all else fails, just say "its gotta be between 100 and 200, so I think 150"
