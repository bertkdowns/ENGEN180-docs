Design Brief
============

This can be long or short. It says:

	- Who this is for (stakeholder)
	- What this is for (purporse)
	- Why this is needed (reason)
	
Background research can be helpful in this, including from:

	- books/journals
	- internet
	- customers
	- experts
	- other designs & patent searches (good & bad)
