Systems
=======

A system is a thing that does stuff. Systems can be made up of subsystems.

In open systems stuff (usually mass) enters and leaves the system.

Steady-state systems don't change, unsteady state systems do.

Accounting Equation
-------------------

Initial Amt + Generation + Input = Final Amnt + Output + Consumption

Yup, we changed from Engineering to accounting. 

You can use this to figure out one of the things if you know the other things.

Mass Balancing Processes
------------------------

Just use algebra. figure out what is an input and what is an output, and make the equations that fit. Then solve the equations.

For example, if we have a process with an input A, and two outputs B and C, from the accounting equation we know mass :math:`A = B + C`. If we also know that input A is 50% water and output B is 90% water, the amount of input water and output water has to add up, so :math:`0.5A = 0.9B + xC` where x is the percentage water of output c. If we know the masses a, b + c, we can easily find out what x is.

Do 1 or 2 practice mass balances to get the hang of it. write out equations for what you know, and solve for what you don't know. remember that the total mass has to balance, but also the mass of the sub components (like water) have to balance as long as they don't change.
