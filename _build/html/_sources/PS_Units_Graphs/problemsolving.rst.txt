Problem solving
===============

Problem types:
	- Research (need to do science to figure stuff out)
	- Knowledge (need to google/learn something)
	- Troubleshooting (stuff not working properly)
	- Resource (need more money, time etc)
	- Design (we already talked about them)
	- Mathematical (we need to use maths to find something)


General Problem Solving Steps
-----------------------------

	- Identify problem
	- Synthesis
		- find a solution idea (like concept generation)
	- Analysis
		- break the idea into parts to consider it (like concept selection)
	- Application
		- identify appropriate info for the problem
	- Comprehension
		- use the data to solve the problem
		
Those are confusing. TRIZ is better:

Specific problem -> General problem -> General solution -> Specific solution

Like in the design process, you can have solutions from different areas.

These things help when solving problems too:
	- Break problem into chunks
	- Use formulas
	- Use heuristics (general guidelines)
	- Start with what you know
	- Persevere
	- Check & recheck

Working as a team helps




Solving Math Problems
---------------------

	- Draw Picture
	- Label known information
	- Label unknowns
	- Use a model (i.e physics equations)
	- Do math to find the unknowns from the equations
	- Check by estimating
