Design Specification
====================

This expands on the design brief with a list of requirements, explicit and implicit.

Explicit requirements are stated in the brief.

Implicit requirements are inferred from the brief, e.g cost. This can also include "sub requirements": requirements we can infer from the more general requirement of the brief.

The design specification needs requirements from all areas:

	- Asthetics
	- Performance - ergonomics, environment, weight, noise
	- Manufacture - process, materials, assembly, packaging
	- Disposal
	- Cost
	- Reliability
	- Timing

It's also probably helpful to include other stuff in the design specification too, such as objectives, why we need to build this, scope of project, etc.
