Sustainability
==============

The UN has a bunch of sustainability goals if you're interested
https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/background.html

But sustainable engineering is about thinking about social and environmental impacts as well as economic. (sometimes called "Triple bottom line)

This means:
	- Don't destroy the environment
	- Be equitable
	- Listen to your stakeholders
	- Conserve resources by:
		- Reducing raw materials required
		- Reducing the disturbance to the natural environment
		- Make stuff durable or recyclable
	- limit emmissions - gasses, waste products, contaminated stuff

A circular economy would be pretty nice - old stuff reused/converted into reusable elements rather than thrown into landfill

Life cycle assesments look at the materials, energy and waste from making/using a product to determine it's environmentability.

Environmental Impact Assesments look more outside the life cycle to see broader impacts the product might be having on the environment.
