Unit Conversions
================

Stuff has units, like
:math:`12 kg/m`
. To convert units you need some kind of unit conversion table with stuff like:

	- 1 m = 3.28 ft
	- 1 kg = 2.2 lb

You can write these as fractions:

:math:`\frac{1m}{3.28ft}` or :math:`\frac{3.28ft}{1m}`

Since 1m = 1 ft, multiplying by this fraction is the same as multiplying by 1. it changes the number, but it also changes the unit too, converting between units. Now you can do this:

:math:`\frac{12kg}{m} * \frac{1m}{3.28ft} * \frac{2.2lb}{1kg}`

Notice the two *m* units cancel out, and the two *kg* units cancel out, because one is on the top and one is on the bottom. You're left with the units of lb/ft. 
Then you just work out the numbers and bam, converted units!

:math:`\frac{12kg}{m} * \frac{1m}{3.28ft} * \frac{2.2lb}{1kg} = \frac{12 * 2.2 lb}{3.28ft} = 8.0 lb/ft`

Temperature is weird, because it is either relative (a change in temperature) or absolute. For absolute temperature use a formula like this: 

:math:`^{\circ} C = (^{\circ} F -32)/1.8`

For relative temperature you can ignore the + or minus bit (but keep the division), or use the temperature interval conversions often written like:

 :math:`\frac{1.8F^{\circ}}{C^{\circ}}`
 
 You can flip these around to get the appropriate fraction for your conversion of course.
 
 Rankine is to Fahrenheit as Kelvin is to Celsius - temperature differences are the same, but one starts at absolute zero the other doesnt.
