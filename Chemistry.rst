Chemistry
=========

This is similar to mass balancing, except you usually use moles instead of kg. Mole balancing.

Moles
-----

A mole is a measure of number of molecules. If you have 1 mol of :math:`CO_2` and 2 mols of :math:`O_2` you have twice as many :math:`O_2` molecules as :math:`CO_2`.

g/mol is a measure of molecular weight. you can use this to figure out grams from mols of the other way around. e.g

C weighs 12 g/mol. so 24 g of carbon = :math:`24g \div \frac{12g}{mol} = 24g \times \frac{mol}{12g} = 2 mol`.

Notice how the grams cancel out because it is on the top and bottom of the fraction. Its basically unit conversion with 12g = 1mol.

A molecular weight can be found for a molecule by adding up the weights of the elements that make it.

E.g H = 1 g/mol, O = 16 g/mol so :math:`H_2O` = :math:`1 \times 2 + 16 = 18` g/mol

Chemical equations
------------------

You get equations like:

:math:`CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O`

The big 2 means 2 mols of the molecule is required.

The amount of the individual atoms (carbon, hydrogen etc) is conserved in a reaction. For example in this equation there are 4 mol of oxygen on the left, and 4 mol on the right. 

Convert everything to mols first. If the question tells us the reaction produces 72g of :math:`H_2O` , we can use the molecular weight of :math:`H_2O` (18g/mol) to find out that the reaction produced 4 mols of :math:`H_2O`. since we know from the equation that twice as many mols of water is produced as carbon dioxide, we know 2 mols of :math:`CO_2` were produced, and use that to find how many grams of :math:`CO_2` were produced.

Stoichiometric Amounts
----------------------

The stoichiometric amount means the perfect amount for it all to be used in the reaction. To find the stoichiometric amount required do the exactly same thing as before. In the above example, the stoichiometric amount of O\ :sub:`2` is 4 mol, because the ratio of :math:`O_2` used to :math:`H_2O` produced is 1:1.

When they say something like 150% the stoichiometric amount (i.e more :math:`O_2` was given then required), just find the stoichiometric amount and multiply by the percentage (1.5 in this case) to find the total amount given.

Mole Fractions and Mass Fractions
---------------------------------
Lets say we have a tank with 1 mol of hydrogen gas, and 3 mols of oxygen gas in it

Mole fraction = amount of mols / total amount of mols.

So in this case the mol fraction of hydrogen gas is 1/(1+3) = 0.25.

Mass fraction = amount of mass / total amount of mass. *This is different.*

Hydrogen gas is 2 g/mol, oxygen gas is 32 g/mol. So the mass of hydrogen in this case is 1\*2=2g, and the mass of oxygen is 3\*32 = 96.

This means the mass fraction of hydrogen gas is 2/98 = 0.02. See, different!

The composition of something on a mass basis means all the mass fractions for that mixture. The composition of something on a mole basis means all the mole fractions for that mixture.


Dry Basis
---------

The mass/mole fractions, excluding water (e.g total mass - mass of water)


Finding a whole amount from a part
----------------------------------

Let's say you need to figure out how much air is required to have 4 mols :math:`O_2`, and that air is 21% :math:`O_2` *on a mol basis (mol fraction)*. to you figure out the total amount of mols of air you can just reverse the mol fraction calculation and divide amount of :math:`O_2` by the mol fraction to find the whole amount of mols. 

In this example 4 mol / 0.21 = 19 mol of air required to have 4 mols of :math:`O_2` 

To turn this into number of grams of air: Let's say the other 79% is :math:`N_2`. To find the mass of air in g you're gonna have to find the number of mols of :math:`N_2` from this, and use the g/mol thing to seperately find the weight of nitrogen gas and oxygen gas, and add them together.

Amount of :math:`N_2`\: 19 * 0.79 = 15 mol :math:`N_2`

Mass of :math:`N_2`\: 15 mol * 28 g/mol = 420 g

Mass of :math:`O_2`: 4 mol * 32 g/mol = 128 grams

Total mass: 420+128 = 548 grams of air required.

If you instead have the *mass fraction* of oxygen in air (23 % :math:`O_2` *on a mass basis*), just use the mass fraction formula to find the total mass from the mass fraction and the mass of oxygen.

4 mol * 32 g/mol = 128g of oxygen. 128 / 0.23 = 557g of air required. 

Note this is slightly different to the previous answer due to rounding. Don't round early \:).
